				<h2>About Me</h2>

					<div class="linebox">
					<img src="assets/images/runerimage.jpg" id="runnerimage">


					<p>     I am a graduate of the University of Maryland, class of 1996.  My major was computer science and my minor is in business.  I started working at a software company in 1996 that specialized in payroll system software which linked  time clocks and payroll systems.  I eventually moved in an information systems financial consultant position and started my own consulting business. </p>

					<p>     Once I became a mother, I moved into a part-time role in the fitness industry.  I am currently a cerified RRCA running coach and participate in several fitness programs.  Although it is very rewarding, I am interested in going back into the software development industry. </p>

					<p>    At home, I have two teenagers.  A boy, Daniel who is 17 and a girl, Gabrielle who is 15. Both of my kids are heavily involved in school and sports which keeps all of us very busy.  We also have a Schnoodle named Molly.  As a family, we enjoy traveling and have been to many destinations in Europe and the U.S. </p>
